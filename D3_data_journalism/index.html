          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between: </h2>
          <h3>Poverty And Access to Healthcare</h3>
          <p>There is a positive correlation between the lack of access to healthcare and the percentage of
            people living in poverty. States such as MA and NH have low poverty rates and exhibit a low percentage of 
            people without access to healthcare, while states like MS and NM are the opposite. The state with the least people
            with access to healthcare is TX, while MA has the most people with access to healthcare.</p>
          <h3>Median Household Income And Obesity</h3>
          <p>Obesity is negatively correlated to median household income. States with less household incomes tend to have higher
            obesity rates, such as MS and AR. At the same time, states like DC and CO have higher median incomes but yield some 
            of the lowest percentages of people with obesity. AR is the state with the most people with obesity, while CO yields
            the least people with obesity.</p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>The results obtained from the previous correlations make sense. For one, people that earn less tend to live in poverty,
            and thus have less money to spend both in healthcare and in healthy food, and as fast food and junk foods in general tend
            to be cheaper, this translates into higher obesity rates.</p>
