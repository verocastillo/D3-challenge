In this homework, I've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper, and I was tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings. The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. To accomplish this, I sifted through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, specifically, a data set included based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. With this, I created a webpage that visualizes two correlations between four variables, with the appropriate conclusions.
