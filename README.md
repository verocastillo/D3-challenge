In this homework, I've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper, and I was tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings. 

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. To accomplish this, I sifted through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, specifically, a data set included based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. With this, I created a webpage that visualizes two correlations between four variables, with the appropriate conclusions.

## Navigating The Repo

Navigating the repository is simple:
- D3_data_journalism contains my HTML, JavaScript and CSS files.
- In images, there are screenshots from the resulting charts and a gif showing the working webpage.

## The Charts

**Poverty vs. Lack of Access to Healthcare**
There is a positive correlation between the lack of access to healthcare and the percentage of people living in poverty. States such as MA and NH have low poverty rates and exhibit a low percentage of people without access to healthcare, while states like MS and NM are the opposite. The state with the least people with access to healthcare is TX, while MA has the most people with access to healthcare.

**Median Household Income vs. Obesity**
Obesity is negatively correlated to median household income. States with less household incomes tend to have higher obesity rates, such as MS and AR. At the same time, states like DC and CO have higher median incomes but yield some of the lowest percentages of people with obesity. AR is the state with the most people with obesity, while CO yields the least people with obesity.

## Conclusions
The results obtained from the previous correlations make sense. For one, people that earn less tend to live in poverty, and thus have less money to spend both in healthcare and in healthy food, and as fast food and junk foods in general tend to be cheaper, this translates into higher obesity rates.
